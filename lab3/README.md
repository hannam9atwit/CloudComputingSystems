# Lab 3 â€“ FastAPI Application  
**Author:** Michael Hanna

## Introduction  
This project is part of Lab 3 for a web development course. It builds on previous labs by implementing a backend application using FastAPI and Uvicorn. The app simulates cookbook-style interactions, allowing users to view and manipulate recipe, feedback, and profile data through RESTful routes.

## Description  
- Developed using Python with FastAPI and Uvicorn  
- Includes 15+ working routes using GET and PUT methods  
- Routes support query strings, path parameters, and JSON body inputs  
- Organized and annotated code for clarity and maintainability  
- A Python test driver script (`driver.py`) sends sample requests to each endpoint  

## Design  
- `main.py`: Core FastAPI server with routes  
- `driver.py`: Python script to test all API functionality  
- Routes cover user profiles, recipe data, comments, feedback, filtering, conversion, and utility endpoints  
- Uses `Request` for body parsing and `Query` / `Path` for input validation
