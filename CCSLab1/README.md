## Introduction

This project is designed to simulate a digital recipe book that’s fun, easy to use, and visually engaging. Users can browse recipes for cookies, banana bread, and explore the inspiration behind the cookbook through a dedicated About page. With smooth page transitions and thematic backgrounds, the experience is crafted to feel more like flipping through a real cookbook than navigating a typical website.
